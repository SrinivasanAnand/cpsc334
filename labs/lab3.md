<h1>Lab 3: 09/21/23 - Anand Srinivasan & Malia Kuo</h1>

<h2>Our first step was to try to create circuits that included each of the components (led light, button, switch, joystick) in a working manner</h2>

Step 1: Creating circuit to light led
* 5v → positive rail → resistor → led → negative rail → ground

Step 2: Creating circuit with switch to LED
* 5v → positive rail → resistor →switch →  led → negative rail → ground

Step 3: Creating circuit with button to LED
* 5v → positive rail → resistor → button →  led → negative rail → ground

Step 4: Creating circuit with button → LED 1 and switch → LED 2
* One side of breadboard: 
  * 5v → positive rail → resistor → button →  led → negative rail → ground
* Other side of breadboard: 
  * 5v → positive rail → resistor →switch →  led → negative rail → ground
 
Step 5: Creating circuit with joystick -> Led (using joystick as button)
* 5v → positive rail → resistor → 5v+ joystick, sv joystick → led → negative rail → ground

<h2>See pictures of circuits below:</h2>

<h2>Next steps (not reached in lab period):</h2>
* Connect circutit to GPIO to allow program to read input from different components (button, switch, joystick).
