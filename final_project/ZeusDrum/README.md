*Electronic Mridangam* is a mridangam-inspired electronic drum-kit.
You can play the instrument by tapping or hitting the different gold touch sensors.
Each sensor triggers one of four notes within a drum kit.
The switch allows the user to select a new kit!

The version of Electronic Mridangam presented at the final showcase includes
four pre-loaded kits, but the system’s design also allows for easy expansion —
new drum kits can be added by adding the four desired sounds to the audio folder
and adding a single line of code. In this way, Electronic Mridangam exposes almost
infinite possibility to the musician, allowing them to experiment with a variety
of their preferred sounds through mridangam-like musicality and play-style.
