# Description

Music wheel is an electronic music instrument, controlled with a button and a joystick.
The joystick controls a central dial, which points to one of eight different sections
of a green wheel in the center of the instrument. Each section represents a different
note within an octave. When the button is pressed, the note being pointed to by the
dial sounds. Music wheel also includes a rewind functionality. When the switch is
turned on, the system goes into “rewind mode.” After the switch is turned off again
(and the music has been “rewound”), whatever music the user played just before rewind
mode was initiated will play. After the completion of this replay, normal functionality will return.

# Additional Features

- **Instrument and scale selection**: the user is able to select between different instruments and scales with which to create music!
- **Rewind functionality**: as described above, the user is able to “rewind” the music in order to hear the music they just created.
- **Save functionality**: music that is “rewound” automatically saves to the user’s local computer.
