Fireplace Deja Vu is an installation piece meant
to capture the visual feeling of fire and flames. 
Flames grow and shrink, and they also change color
and flicker along spectrums of orange, red, yellow. 
In addition to its attempt to mimic the warmth and
beauty of fire, Fireplace Deja Vu is meant to provide
a mechanism to visualize the enclosure’s interaction
with its surrounding environment. Furthermore, 
the system provides a novel way of visualizing
and “re-experiencing” or “replaying” an ambient setting. 
This effect is discussed more later in this section,
after a quick overview of sensor functions.

**Behind the scenes**:

- A light sensor controls the strength of the flames. Stronger flames are produced in darker settings.
    - Note: In the default state (when surrounding lighting
    - is equivalent to the original lighting of the system when started),
      flames slowly wane until reaching a low-level
      minimum (flames never fully die out).
- A DIY touch sensor controls a “replay” function.

### The replay effect:

 When a replay is triggered, the entire history of growth
 (in non replay mode) is repeated. After this process, 
 normal mode of operation is resumed.

Since, when a replay is triggered, the current positioning
of the flames may not be equivalent to the original positioning
of the flames, the “replay” flames may not be identical
to the original flames. Only the pattern of growth will be conserved.
This choice is intentional.

### Why wireless?

One reason for this project’s need for wireless communication 
is the the unseen effect. I wanted the enclosure to be interacted
with separately from the display on screen. As such, I wanted to
establish a sense of disconnect between the enclosure and the display,
by eliminating any wires between them. It is important that the display
represents the interaction between the enclosure and its surroundings,
and that the interaction between the enclosure and its surroundings
is not too heavily influenced by the display itself.

Moreover, this system would be best situated in one of two settings:
an outdoor location or an exhibit with lots of natural light.
The system is designed to reflect natural changes in lighting 
in addition to changes in lighting due to viewer interactions.
